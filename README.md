# Load-Balancer
<p>The program is based on client/server communication via WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) services. The client-side is represented by the "Writer," while the server-side is represented by the "LoadBalancer." The LoadBalancer receives requests from the Writer and then distributes the processing of item structure objects to the Worker components.</p>
